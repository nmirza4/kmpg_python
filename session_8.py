# Questions:
# Section A
# 1. Read the file 'jabberwocky.txt' and print its content to the screen

f = open("jabberwocky.txt","r")
print(f.read())

# 2. Read the file 'austen.txt' and print the amount of lines in the file

f = open("austen.txt","r")
count=0
for line in f:
  count += 1

print(count)


# 3. Each line of the file 'numbers.txt' contains a number, write a script to add up all the values in the file
f = open("numbers.txt","r")
total = 0
for line in f:
  total += int(line)

print(total)



# 1. Ask the user to enter their name and append this to a file called 'register.txt'

# f = open("register.txt", "a")

# name=True
# while name != "":
#   name = input("What is your name?")
#   if name:
#     f.write(name + "\n")

# f.close()


# 2. Create a new file called 'even.txt' that contains only the even numbers from the file 'numbers.txt'
f = open("even.txt", "w")

for line in open ("numbers.txt", "r"):

# 4. Benfordâ€™s law states that the leading digits in a collection of data are probably going to be small. For example, most numbers in a set (about 30%) will have a leading digit of 1, when the expected probability is 11.1% (i.e. one out of nine digits). Fake data is usually evenly distributed, where as real data The files 'accounts_1.txt', 'accounts_2.txt' and 'accounts_3.txt' contain financial transaction data. Work out which of the files contains fake data.
