# Section A
# 1. Create two variables that hold the width and height of a rectangle, work out and store the area in a third variable. Print out the string: `Rectangle of width *x* and height *y* has an area of *area*`.

#x = 5
#y = 6

#area = x * y 

#print(area)

#print("Rectangle of the width" + str(x) + "and the height" + str(y) + "has an area of" + str(area))

# 2. Write code that prints the length of the string, 'python'.
# 3. Print out the first and third letter of the word 'python'.
#word="python"
#print(len(word))
#print(word[0])
#print(word[5])

# 4. Ask the user to enter their name, and print out `Hello, *name*`.
#name=input("What is your name?")
#print("Hello"+name)

# 5. Ask the user to enter their age, tell them how old they will be in 15 years time.
#age=int(input("What is your age?"))
#in_fifteen_years= age+15
#print("In fifteen years you will be" + str(in_fifteen_years))


# 6. Combine the two input statements above and print out the message `Hello, *name*, you are currently *age* years old. In 15 years time you will be *age_in_15_years_time*`.
#print("Hello" + name + ",you are currently" +str (age)+ "years old.In 15 years time you will be" + str(in_fifteen_years) + "years old")

# 7. Ask the user to enter their hometown, print it out in uppercase letters.
#hometown=input("What is your hometown")
#print(hometown.upper())
# 8.Ask the user to enter their favourite colour and find out the length of the colour they input.
#favourite_colour=input("What is your favourite colour?")
#print(len(favourite_colour))
# 9. Ask the user to enter the weather and the month. Print out the string, `It is *month* and it is *weather* today`.

#weather=input("What is the weather?\n")
#print("The weather is " +weather)

#month=input("\nWhat is the month?\n")
#print("The month is " +month)

#print("\nThe weather is "+ weather + " and the month is " +month)

# 10. Ask the user to enter 5 different temperatures and the month. Work out the average temperature and print out the string, `It is *month* and the average temperature is *average_temperature* degrees celsius`.
#temp1=int(input("What is the first temp"))
#temp2=int(input("What is the second temp"))
#temp3=int(input("What is the third temp"))
#temp4=int(input("What is the fourth temp"))
#temp5=int(input("What is the fifth temp"))

#average = ((temp1+temp2+temp3+temp4+temp5)/5)
#print(average)

# 11. Print out the above sentence but make the month upper case.
#print("It is " + month.upper() + "and the average teperature is " + str(average))
# 12. Create a variable that holds your favourite animals and print it out. Make sure the animals are all on different lines and tabbed.
#favourite_animals = ("\n\t Dogs\n\t Birds\n\t Bears\n\t Zebras")
#print("My favourite animals are:" + favourite_animals)

# 13. Ask the user to enter their name as well as a number. Print out the uppercase character at that position in the string.
# name = input("What is your name")
# number= int(input("Pick a number"))
# print(name[number].upper())
